I have developed spectral energy distributions appropriate for a wide
range of interstellar environments and thus heating intensity levels U
(from 0.3 to 100,000 times the local ISRF).  In an attempt to mimic what
happens in a "real" galaxy, I have constructed galaxy SEDs by combining
the individual SEDs according to a power-law distribution in U:

dM(U) ~ U^{-alpha} dU,

where M(U) represents the dust mass heated by U.  Each SED corresponds 
to a slightly different exponent (alpha).  As it turns out, only a 
portion of these spectra are applicable to our normal  galaxy sample: 
alpha~2.6 at the quiescent end, and alpha~1 at the active end.  Models 
with alpha<1 may apply to more active galaxies.

------------------
This file contains the model SEDs for a range of alpha, 0.0625 to 4.  The
spectra span a wavelength range of 0.36 um to 1100 um.  Beware that I've
only constrained the models from 3 to 850 microns.
