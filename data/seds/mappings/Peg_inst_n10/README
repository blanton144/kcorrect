Photoionization Grid for Pegase instantaneous burst models
with electron density of 10/cm^3.   

The grid was run by Lisa Kewley and is described in
Dopita et al. 2000, ApJ, 542, 224.

Naming convention for output files (gzipped)

type_metallicity_age_ionization-parameter.ph4.gz

where type is either:
spec  = emission line list - gives wavelength and flux in each 
        emission line (this is the most commonly used output file).
photn = ionizing conditions through the nebula at each step size 
        through the model.
phapn = plasma properties (eg., pressure, sound speed, Mag field)
phlss = information about energy conservation through the nebula
    

See http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~lkewley/Mappings/Output.html
for a detailed description of the contents in each of these files.
